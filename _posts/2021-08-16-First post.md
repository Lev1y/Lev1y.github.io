This is my first post. No academic topic is discussed but special thanks to [Jekyll Academic Theme](https://github.com/yak-fumblepack/jekyll-academic) for its amazingly simple and efficient blog framework, as well as [northendlab Theme](https://github.com/gethugothemes/northendlab-hugo) for its fruitful graphs and inspiring content design. With the aid of their templates, this blog was successfully set up in 3 days (even I'm not familiar with Ruby). So if you are keen on making your personal blog without spending much time, and of course for free, do check and follow their repository.

Back to talking about my blog. Though I initially created this for job hunting, I find happiness in sharing my experience, maybe they could be helpful for your research or even solving your problem in hand. The blog also mirrors my status chronologically, makes me chilled and condense my thought into words. Anyway, I guess there will be more fancy ideas, findings, articles and tools that I want to share with you.

I see you in the next post.
