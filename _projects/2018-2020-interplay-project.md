## **Background** ##
Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is one of the widely used material for the commercial membrane, due to its good physiochemical properties but low unit price. However, the unmodified PAN membrane is incompatible with the application of oil/water separation because of the severe oil-fouling issue. It was reported that when membrane phase separation and alkaline hydrolysis of PAN were performed simultaneously, the obtained membrane showed greatly enhanced surface hydrophilicity and oleophobicity, which was promising for separating oil/water. However, the mechanism behind such combined process remained unknown, which hindered its application in research and path to commercialization. Therefore, it was meaningful to understand the interplay between the PAN membrane phase separation and PAN alkaline hydrolysis, as well as their influences on the membrane structure and surface properties.  

## **Objective** ##
The ultimate objective of this project is to study the interplay between the PAN membrane phase separation and PAN alkaline hydrolysis, and evaluate their influences on the membrane structure and surface properties, as well as anti-oil fouling performance during filtration tests.

## **Method** ##
Three types of PAN membranes were prepared: unmodified PAN, p-hPAN and s-hPAN membranes, where p-hPAN underwent the conventional alkaline post-hydrolysis, while s-hPAN were prepared by the alkaline-induced phase separation process.

Through changing the phase separation duration and alkaline concentration, the membrane morphologies and surface properties of s-hPAN were compared with p-hPAN. The membrane characterization methods include SEM, FTIR, XPS spectrum, contact angle, porometry, MWCO measurement, etc. The membrane filtration tests involved oil emulsion, humic substance and protein as the model contaminants.
