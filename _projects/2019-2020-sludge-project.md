## **Background** ##
The municipal solid waste (MSW) in Asia is increasing rapidly with fast economic growth and consumption of resources. In city-states like Singapore, around 1/4 of its land are reclaimed by the landfill project due to land scarcity. As a result, the previously used MSW landfills may be reused. It is almost impossible to excavate the existing landfills and deposit the contaminated soil to less populated zones. This necessitates a strong need to “stabilize” the MSW in-situ. The “MSW stabilization” refers to both mechanical and environmental stabilization. The former means the increase of the strength and stiffness of the material, and a stability of the landfill and overlying buildings. The latter focuses on the stabilization of hazardous heavy metals to control their leaching. Previous studies on stabilized MSW sludge were either on mechanical behavior or on heavy metal leaching behavior. In fact, the improved MSW sludge is subjected to certain loading, which may affect the diffusion of heavy metals. So far, no existing studies have examined the effect of loading on leaching effect of heavy metals in stabilized MSW sludge.  

## **Objective** ##
The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of MSW stabilization from both mechanical strength and leaching behavior of heavy metals under loading.  

## **Method** ##
Currently not available due to the relevant publication is in progress.

## **Selected results** (to be cont.) ##
