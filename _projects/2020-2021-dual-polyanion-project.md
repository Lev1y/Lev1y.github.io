<h2 style="color: #aaaaaa">Period: 2020 - 2021</h2>

## **Background** ##
Membrane with superhydrophilic and superoleophobic surface is ideal for the application of oil/water separation because of high water permeability and low fouling tendency to oil. Many of the studies fabricate the superwetting membrane surface through grafting of zwitterionics. This is due to the strong interactions between the charged moieties from zwitterionics and water molecules would form a hydration layer near the membrane surface and therefore prevent the oil adhesion. However, most of the grafting modification used atomic-transfer radical polymerization technique, which is not fully commercialized yet. Therefore, the development of a facile modification method to achieve superwetting membrane surface is meaningful.

## **Objective** ##
The ultimate objective of this project is to develop an easy-to-conduct but effective modification method to achieve superhydrophilic and superoleophobic property on polyacrylonitrile membrane surface.

## **Method** ##
Currently not available due to the relevant publication is in progress.
