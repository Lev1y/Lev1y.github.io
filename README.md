# About blog

Lev1y is a lightweight github page for personal usage which is forked from [yak-fumblepack/jekyll-academic](https://github.com/yak-fumblepack/jekyll-academic). Fork from my repository is welcome, however I strongly recommond you to use the original theme above to prevent any possible bugs.

## Update

- An email contact page is added by using [Formspree](https://formspree.io/). To make it yours, change the form action in `_layouts` -> `contact.html`.

## License

This theme is licensed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). See [LICENSE](https://github.com/yak-fumblepack/jekyll-academic/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) file for more details.
